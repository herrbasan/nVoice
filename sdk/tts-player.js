/**
 * TtsPlayer — sentence-at-a-time speech for an assistant reply.
 *
 * Playback is the window that matters for barge-in. Synthesis queues behind
 * generation, so the assistant keeps talking long after the server has gone back
 * to listening — and only the client knows when audio is still coming out of the
 * speaker. The server therefore cannot be the judge of "the assistant is still
 * speaking"; cutting playback is the application's job. This is that job.
 *
 * Feed it reply tokens as they stream. Each complete sentence is synthesized and
 * spoken, with the next one synthesized while the current one plays, so playback
 * runs continuously instead of pausing between sentences. `stop()` cuts the audio
 * immediately and drops everything not yet spoken — that is the barge-in.
 *
 * Synthesis is nSpeech (`POST /v1/audio/speech`). Zero dependencies.
 *
 * Playback does not go straight to an <audio> element. It runs through a local
 * WebRTC loopback, because Chromium's AEC takes its reference from WebRTC playout:
 * audio that never passes through it is not cancelled, and the mic keeps hearing
 * the assistant. The path is created once and kept open for the session — AEC is
 * adaptive and needs seconds to converge, so a fresh sink per sentence never gives
 * it a stable reference to learn. `prime()` builds it inside a user gesture, since
 * autoplay policy suspends an AudioContext created outside one.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const tts = new TtsPlayer({ onEvent: e => ... });
 *   client.on('reply', d => tts.push(d.result.text));   // stream tokens
 *   client.on('phase', d => { if (d.phase === 'done') tts.flush(); });
 *   client.on('barge-in', () => tts.stop('keyword'));      // only interrupts
 *   client.on('duck', () => tts.duck());                    // sustained speech
 *   client.on('speech-end', () => setTimeout(() => tts.unduck(), 1000));
 *
 * iOS: call `await tts.resume()` from inside the user gesture that starts the
 * session (prime() does this), and listen for the 'suspended' event — silent
 * output raises no error otherwise.
 *
 * Classic script: exposes `window.TtsPlayer` in the browser, exports for Node.
